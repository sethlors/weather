This directory contains daily weather images that are referenced by the weather display pages.

Your weather station software should save images here, such as:
- WindDirection.gif
- RainRateHistory.gif
- And other daily weather graphs

If your weather software saves images to a different location, you can either:
1. Update the paths in your .htx template files, or
2. Configure your software to save images to this directory
